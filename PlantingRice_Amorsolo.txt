Fernando Amorsolo y Cueto (May 30, 1892 â€“ April 24, 1972) was a portraitist and painter of rural Philippine landscapes. Nicknamed the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art,"[2] he was the first-ever to be recognized as a National Artist of the Philippines.[3] He was recognized as such for his "pioneering use of impressionistic technique" as well as his skill in the use of lighting and backlighting in his paintings, "significant not only in the development of Philippine art but also in the formation of Filipino notions of self and identity."[4]
My perspective as an Artist on the painting Planting Rice by Fernando Amorsolo.
As an artist the painting symbolized the peacefulness of the Filipinos after the PHilippine-American War, the painting made a narrative that the Filipinos value the simple life rather than the urban lifestyles endengered by the industrialization.
